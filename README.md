# Reputable

![logo](readme/logo.png)

`Reputable` makes it easy for users to create their own tokens. Tokens may be used for various services. Since all tokens have a common total supply and inflation rate, the price becomes personal credit. It is useful for designing credit-based apps such as dynamic returns.
